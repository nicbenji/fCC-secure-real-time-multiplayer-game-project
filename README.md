# Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/secure-real-time-multiplayer-game

Create a secure multiplayer game in which each player can move their avatar, there is at least one collectible item, and the rank of the players is calculated based on their score.

For details consult the tests below.

Make sure that your game is secure! Include these security measures:

    The client should not be able to guess/sniff the MIME type
    Prevent XSS attacks
    Do not cache anything from the website in the client
    The headers say that the site is powered by PHP 7.4.3

Note: helmet@^3.21.3 is needed for the user stories. This means you will need to use the previous version of Helmet's docs, for information on how to achieve the user stories.
